## Pi-vis (Monte Carlo Pi Approximation Visualizer)
This website visualizes the approximation of PI using the Monte Carlo method. It begins with a square and an inscribed quadrant. Then, points are randomly scattered over the square using JavaScript. The number of points inside the quadrant is counted and the ratio is used to estimate PI.
